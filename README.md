This project is the result of a lot of research done by myself and
from a lot of work found on the internet, especially Github and Stackoverflow

# Introduction

thanks to WiFi. Although, there are many projects around IoT applications
no one has ever (as far as I know) make communication via WhatsApp on its own.
